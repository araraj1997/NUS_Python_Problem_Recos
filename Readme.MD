During my Internship period from 14th May - 13th July 2018 at ALSET , I worked on creating recommendation engines that were based on data collected by ALSET on their achievements App and creating Machine Learning Tutorials for an Undergraduate Course at NUS .

The first recommendation engine I created was for Jupyter Inline problems made for students who were beginners in Python.It analyzed the solution code and found out all the libraries and functions used in their code and made a recommendation for a problem that has the highest likelihood of that function being used.

I also created another recommendation engine that analyzed  tags given to videos on the Achievements App  by users and made recommendations to users based on the similarity(cosine-similarity) of the tags used in all the videos they watched with the next video.

I created Tutorials and Problems based on Sci-Kit Learn and Tensor flow for  an Undergraduate Course on Machine Learning(CS3244).These Tutorials covered various topics ranging from Naive-Bayes Classifiers to Convolutional Neural Networks and were created using Jupyter Notebooks.

I also created a Text Summarizer that summarized all the comments from Youtube Videos that were used as learning material for students at NUS using the Youtube API to get data from Youtube and making a summary based on the frequency of the  words seen in the comments.
